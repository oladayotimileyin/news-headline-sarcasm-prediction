# news-headline-sarcasm-prediction
*This is a project to predict if news headline is sarcastic or not.*

*I worked on a dataset containing news headlines that are intended to be written sarcastically by the news author.
The aim here is to train NLP models to determine whether or not the headline is sarcastic.*
